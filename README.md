# HTML5 Elements Example

This project demonstrates various HTML5 elements and their usage. It provides examples of common HTML5 features like ordered lists, images, audio, video, tables, and forms. Below is a brief explanation of each section of the HTML code:

## Features

### 1. Ordered List with Roman Numerals
This section shows how to create an ordered list using Roman numerals as list markers. The `<ol>` element is used with the `type="I"` attribute to specify Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.).

### 2. External Image
This section demonstrates how to include an external image on your webpage. The `<img>` element is used with the `src` attribute pointing to an external URL, and the `alt` attribute provides an alternate text description for the image.

### 3. Audio Example
This section shows how to embed an audio file on a webpage. The `<audio>` element is used with the `controls` attribute to add basic playback controls (like play, pause, and volume). It uses the `<source>` tag to specify the audio file source, and provides a fallback message if the audio element is unsupported by the browser.

### 4. Video Example
Here, a video is embedded on the page using the `<video>` element. The `controls` attribute is included to allow users to play, pause, and adjust the volume of the video. The video is linked via the `<source>` tag, and a fallback message is displayed for unsupported browsers.

### 5. Contacts Table
A simple table is created using the `<table>` element. This section demonstrates how to organize and display contact information such as name, address, phone number, and email in rows and columns. It uses the `<thead>` and `<tbody>` elements to separate the header and body of the table, and the `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags to define table rows, headers, and data cells respectively.

### 6. Registration Form
This section features a basic HTML form that collects user information. The form includes various input types:
- **Text field** for the user's name
- **Email field** to capture an email address
- **Password field** for secure entry of a password
- **Date field** for selecting a birth date
- **Dropdown** for selecting a country
- **Radio buttons** for selecting gender
- **Checkboxes** for selecting hobbies
Finally, the form includes a **submit button** that will send the data to the server (though no action is specified in this example).
